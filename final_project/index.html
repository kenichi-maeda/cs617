        <p>An In-Depth Exploration of Crime Trends and Safety insights in Boston</p>
        By Kenichi Maeda
    </div>
    
    <div class="preface">
        With a population of 675,647 (as of 2022), Boston is known as one of the largest cities in the United States. 
        What makes Boston “Boston” is nothing but its educational influence. It is home to many prestigious universities, 
        which attract numerous young people. Indeed, the median age of the population is 33.3 years old, much younger 
        than the U.S. median. Boston is also known for its diversity. Data shows that foreign-born population accounts for 
        27.6 % of the total.<br><br>
        In such an ever-changing city, you may have ever wondered “How safe is Boston?” When, 
        where, and what dangers lie ahead?  Whether you are a long-time resident or a newcomer to the city, 
        this question is crucial for a safe and enjoyable life in Boston. <br><br>
        In this project, we will analyze Boston’s public safety data, and explore what kind of trends exist 
        and what kind of preparation we could make.

    </div>

    <div class="Boston">
        <h3>Boston</h3>
        First, let us take a look at where Boston stands in terms of public safety. The 2013 Boston Marathon Bombings 
        shook Boston and the entire world, but generally everyone has the impression that Boston is a safe place. 
        How is it actually?
        <div class="containerBoston1" style="display: flex;">
            <div class="imageBoston1" style="flex: 2;">
                <svg class="usCities" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></svg>
            </div>
            <div class="textBoston1" style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
                The left graph shows the chances of being a victim of a violent crime per 1,000 residents in major 
                U.S. cities, including Boston. All of them exceed the national median probably due to the fact that 
                they are all big cities and have so many people.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="containerBoston2" style="display: flex;">
            <div class="imageBoston2" style="flex: 2;">
                <svg class="maCities" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></svg>
            </div>
            <div class="textBoston2" style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
                The following plot shows the same number for the state of Massachusetts. As you can imagine, the more suburban towns (e.g., Amherst and Dartmouth) 
                are safer. Boston is not necessarily a safe city in this category probably because it is the largest city in Massachusetts.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="Crimes">
        <h3>Crimes</h3>
        Let’s narrow our focus to Boston only. The data presented below are from 
        <a href="https://data.boston.gov/dataset/crime-incident-reports-august-2015-to-date-source-new-system">crime incident 
        reports</a> provided by the City of Boston. These reports record incidents and accidents handled by the Boston police,
        and are publicly accessible. It is worth mentioning here that these reports include general duties and 
        accidents that the police deal with, such as property crimes, traffic accidents, child assistance, and more. 
        For the purpose of this project, I only included crimes that could happen to the general public (e.g., theft, 
        assault, etc.) and removed cases such as accidents, criminal investigations, and properties related crimes.<br><br>

        Below is a year-by-year breakdown on the number of crimes, showing that the numbers were high from 2016 to 2019, 
        but then dropped from 2020 to 2022. This decline can be explained by the Covid19 pandemic. As people refrained from going out, 
        the number of crimes dropped accordingly.
        You should also see that the number of crimes turned slightly upward in 2023. Now that the pandemic is over, the number 
        of crimes is expected to increase again.
        <svg class="numberOfCrimesTotal" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></svg>

        Let’s look at the number of crimes by crime type, and see if we still observe the trend.

        <div class="containerCrime1" style="display: flex;">
            <div class="containerCrime1" style="flex: 2;">
                <br>
                <svg class="numberOfCrimesAssault" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></svg>
            </div>
            <div class="containerCrime1" style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
                <audio id="pop-sound" src="data/pop.mp3"></audio>
                <h3>Assaults</h3>
                The number of assaults shows the same trend as the total number of crimes. Although the number fell during the pandemic, 
                it has been gradually increasing. Note that the number of crimes itself is also high.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="containerCrime2" style="display: flex;">
            <div class="containerCrime2" style="flex: 2;">
                <audio id="pop-sound" src="data/pop.mp3"></audio>
                <br>
                <svg class="numberOfCrimesBurglary" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></svg>
            </div>
            <div class="containerCrime2" style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
                <h3>Burglary</h3>
                Interestingly, the number of burglary has been decreasing since 2016 and it is still following the trend even after the pandemic. 
                I do not know if there is any reason for this, but it is good news for us!
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="containerCrime3" style="display: flex;">
            <div class="containerCrime3" style="flex: 2;">
                <audio id="pop-sound" src="data/pop.mp3"></audio>
                <br>
                <svg class="numberOfCrimesHarassment" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></svg>
            </div>
            <div class="containerCrime3" style="flex: 1; padding: 10px;">
                <h3>Harassment</h3>
                The number of harassment cases has remained flat. There were numerous reports of increased harassment against specific
                races and ethnicities throughout the U.S. during the pandemic. This might be the reason why we have not seen a decrease in the number 
                of crimes during the pandemic.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="Trends">
        <h3>Trends</h3>
        Knowing when crime is likely to occur is another important step to understanding Boston’s safety. Once you know when 
        crime is likely to occur, it becomes easier to take action.

        <h4>Monthly Trends</h4>
        <svg class="monthlyTrends" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></svg>
        First, monthly trends. The graph above shows the number of crimes per day over the span of a year from 2015 to 2024 
        (note that 2015 and 2024 only have the data for the second half of the year and the first half of the year respectively). 
        If I had to guess, I would say that the peak appears to be in the summer season around August and September. But the data
        shows no particular trend, in other words, there are no particularly safe or dangerous seasons.

        <h4>Weekly Trends</h4>
        <svg class="weeklyTrends" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></svg>
        Next, let us take a look at the weekly trends. This graph shows the average number of crimes for each day of the week. All graphs are 
        flat, and again, there is no significant change. But if we had to say something, there is a slight increase on Fridays, 
        which might be due to the fact that it is the end of the week and people are more active.

        <h4>Hourly Trends</h4>
        <svg class="daytimeTotal" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></svg>
        Finally, here are the hourly trends. It makes sense that there are fewer crimes at night when everyone is in bed. I would 
        assume that the large spike at 12:00 p.m. is not simply due to a higher number of crimes, but rather because the police tend 
        to file cases at 12:00 p.m.

        Do we see this trend in each of the crime cases?
        <div class="containerTrend" style="display: flex;">
            <div class="containerTrend1" style="flex: 1; padding: 10px; width: 33.3% ">
                <svg class="daytimeAssault" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></svg>
                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0%; margin-top: 0%;">Assaults</h4>
                Although there are not so many crime cases, assaults occur at any hour of the day. Crimes are also observed from 1:00 a.m. 
                to 3:00 a.m. at night. It would be best to avoid going out at late night.
            </div>
            <div class="containerTrend2" style="flex: 1; padding: 10px; width: 33.3% " >
                <svg class="daytimeTheft" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></svg>
                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0%; margin-top: 0%;">Thefts</h4>
                This shows a big increase in the evening, which is probably correlated with the movement of people. As it is the end 
                of the day, people are more likely to be out, making them easy targets for crime. One must be careful when walking in 
                the city in the evening.
            </div>
            <div class="containerTrend3" style="flex: 1; padding: 10px; width: 33.3% ">
                <svg class="daytimeVandalism" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></svg>
                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0%; margin-top: 0%;">Vandalism</h4>
                It might not be directly related to us, but we see that the number is high between 10:00 p.m. to 12:00 p.m. Again, it 
                is best avoid being out at night.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="Areas">
        <h3>Areas</h3>
        Finally, let’s look at where crime is most likely to occur. It is often said that there are security concerns in cities such 
        as Dorchester and Roxbury, but how is this really the case? Below is a map of the number of crimes per police districts. For 
        the purpose of visualization, I rescaled the highest and lowest number of crimes to 100 and 0 respectively.

        In terms of the number of crimes, downtown and South End are red flags. The high population density makes it 
        unsurprising that the number of crimes is high these areas. As we move toward the suburbs, we see a decrease in the number of crimes.<br><br>
        Is there any correlation between crime types and areas? This time, the legend shows the actual number of crimes.

                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0%;">Assaults</h4>
                In addition to downtown and South End, it is worth noticing that assaults happen frequently in Roxbury as well. 
                It is hard to avoid these areas, but you might want to at least avoid back alleys etc.

                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0%;">Thefts</h4>
                This also occurs not only in the center of the city, but also in a wide range of neighborhoods, including Brighton, 
                South Boston, and Dorchester. It can be said that people are more likely to be victims in busy places than in residential 
                areas for this type of crime.

                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0%;">Harassment</h4>
                While the number of crimes itself is not that high, it is noteworthy that it occurs in all areas to a similar degree. 
                It might be better to keep in mind that harassment can occur anywhere.

    <div class="Conclusion">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        Boston cannot be considered a perfectly safe place due to its nature as a large city. In particular, we have seen thefts occur 
        frequently in the evenings when the streets get busy, especially in downtown. However, this is true for any city with a large 
        population. As long as you keep in mind obvious things, such as not geting caught off guard in a crowded area, not going out alone at 
        night, etc., Boston can be a great place for you!
